            <h2>1. THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT BREEDS OF CORGIS</h2>

            <p>
                There are two types of Welsh corgis: the Pembroke Welsh corgi and the Cardigan Welsh corgi. They are
                considered two entirely different breeds because they come from different ancestors. Their remarkable
                resemblance is a result of crossbreeding in the 19th century.
                If you’re trying to tell the two breeds apart, the most notable difference is that the Pembroke does not
                have a tail. On top of a tail, Cardigan Welsh corgis also have rounded ears, while Pembrokes generally
                have pointy ears.

            <h2>2. THE CARDIGAN WELSH CORGI IS THE OLDER BREED</h2>
            <img src="Corgi-02.jpg" class="float-right" />
            <p>
                A warrior tribe of Celts brought the corgis in their aboriginal form to Cardiganshire, Wales around 1200
                BCE, which means corgis have been in Wales for over 3000 years. This early breed was a member of the
                Teckel family of dogs that went on to include the dachshund.

                Although no one knows for sure, most agree that the Pembroke Welsh corgi dates back to 1107 CE when
                Flemish weavers migrated to Wales. The Spitz-type dog bred with the original Cardigan corgis to produce
                the Pembroke Welsh corgis we know today.
